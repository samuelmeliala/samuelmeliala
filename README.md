<h1> Hello, I'm Samuel ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I am a high school graduate, and am currently studying at Bina Nusantara University majoring in Computer Science, focusing in Mobile Application and Technology. Currently I am learning about Flutter Development, Cross-Platform Development, and Web Development. While Iâ€™m still developing my skills and learning the ropes, Iâ€™m eager to dive into real-world projects through internships and further my development. I thrive on challenges, whether itâ€™s improving app performance or crafting smooth user experiences.
